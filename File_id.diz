This app shows how you can interact with
a Flash (SWF) in Visual Basic. Made in
VB 5 and Flash 4. Both the VB-source and
the Flash-source are included, and
commented. There's a simple way to control
a named movieclip in a Flash from VB, see
for yourself!

PS: Make sure you've got a ShockWave OCX!
(Flash 4 or 5...)
